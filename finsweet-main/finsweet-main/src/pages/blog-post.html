              How can a website help your buissness
            </h1>
          </div>
          <div class="blog_post_content raw_content">
            <p>
              Thinking of getting a website for your buissness? Maybe your not sure how it can help you grow your
              buissness and revenue let us show you. A website is like adding a buissness within your buissness.
              That might sound confusing but think of it like this you have your in-person buissness and your 
              virtual buissness. People can find and order from buissness online and in-peron.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              A website is like taking or scaling your buissnes to that next level. 
              Because not only can people find your buissnes in-person but they can find it online. 
              You see in todays society social media and the internet is a big thing, more than 60% of the world 
              is on the web. Thats 60% of the world misssing without access to your buissnes to order or contact you.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Websites not only drive traffic to those who find it on the web, but also those who found it friends. 
              That probally did not make sense but have you ever sent an intresting article or funny video to someone?
               The answer is probally yes. That is the same with your buissnes if someone finds your buissnes good and 
               are satified with their results from your buissness/service they will send it to other whom could use 
               or would find it intresting.
            </p>
